🛡️ Born2beroot

System administration meets cybersecurity!

Born2beroot is a 42 School project that introduced me to system configuration, security hardening, and Linux administration. The goal was to set up a virtual machine following strict security requirements, manage users and permissions, and enforce essential system policies.

🔹 Key concepts learned:
	•	Setting up and configuring a Debian-based virtual machine
	•	Implementing password policies and sudo configurations
	•	Partitioning disks and managing LVM (Logical Volume Manager)
	•	Enabling a UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) and SSH hardening
	•	Creating and enforcing a custom security script

This project pushed me to think like a sysadmin and understand the importance of securing a system from the ground up. 🛠️🔐
